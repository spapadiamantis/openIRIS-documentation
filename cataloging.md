# Resource Cataloging

## EuBI nomenclature

When cataloging resources for OpenIRIS PICsL structures use the European BioImaging (EuBI) proposed nomenclature that can be found [here]().

For example each resource includes the EuBI category tag in each Title in order to quicly identify its functionality. We also added several "Resource Types" according to EuBI standars.

## Mass resource Importing

We can upload a lot of resources silmutaneously by using the "Import with asset info" feature of Open IRIS. We can download the .xlsx template from the Admin > Resources tab.

Some notes on the import template:

- required columns begin with REQUIRED:
- most OpenIRIS objects (PROVIDERS or RESOURCES for example) are referenced with a "Globally Unique identidier" GUID that can be found in eache objects tab
- the template contains a great amount of information. There are specific columns that are not visible by users, but can be useful to administrators. Feel free to add as much info as you can even if it seems excessive
