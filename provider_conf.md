# Provider Configurations

## Visibility
All PROVIDERS are publicly visible and any user can request access. If a user is a part of the PICsL or FBI COMMUNITIES they are accorded access by default.

### Appearance in searches

Users can sort their results using filters in the leftmost side of the browse tab. Searching keywords such as  "FBI" or "France BioImaging" for example will not present out providers as results. To solve this we added some generic text in the information tab of each PROVIDER.

Example of text used:

"The facility is also a member of the Marseille node of France-BioImaging (FBI) and participates in the Plateforme dâ€™imagerie commune du site de Luminy (PICsl) community that regroups a number of scientific imaging facilities around the Luminy Campus of Aix-Marseille University (AMU)"
