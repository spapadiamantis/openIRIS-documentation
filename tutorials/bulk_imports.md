## Bulk Imports

Bulk imports can save us a great amount of time when administrating in OpenIRIS. We can bulk import a number of entities such as resources, bookings,users e.a.
You can find templates for each entity in the administrator tab. These templates are served in the form of excel(.xlsx) files.

### Notes

- Do not center-align or color-code cells. 
- Make sure that all required fields are filled out. 
- All providers are to be reffered to using their GUID.
- As a rule of thumb try to include as much information as possible, this can help administrators and users to distinguish resources.
