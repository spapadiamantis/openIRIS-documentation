# Calendars in OpenIRIS

OpenIRIS provides a number of calendar feeds in .ics format that can be loaded to you mail client. We can get a number of information on resources and events by PROVIDER,GROUP or USER.

Here is a small tutorial of how to import you personal calendar feed to a Microsoft Outlook (one of the most used email clients in AMU):

1) Go to Dashboard> Personal Overview
2) Click on "Bookings iCAL FeeD"
3) Copy the link
4) Go to your Outlook Client
5) Calendar > Add calendar > from internet
6) Paste link in the prompt 


Note that calendars are updated on specific basis determined by your calendar client. Google Calendar for example takes at most 8 hours to refresh. This issue is not related to OpenIRIS in any way.
