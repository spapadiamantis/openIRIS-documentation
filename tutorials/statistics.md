###OpenIRIS API

For administrative purposes we have created a Python API that can draw information directly from the site's database, in order to save time and separate the website's
administration and our insitutes' billing services. This API permits the accounting team to have a steady streamof information but it can mine a variety of data.
Our goal at the moment is to extend it as much as possible and package it for Python so other nodes of the FBI network can use it as well.

We will upload the code to a github repository as soon as the first version is ready and link it here.
